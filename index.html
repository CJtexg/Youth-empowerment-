 <h1><Marquee>WELCOME TO YOUNG'S WORLD</Marquee></h1>
 <br>
<P>IN YOUNG WORLD WE DON'T ONLY EMPOWER YOUTH WITH TEMPORARY WEALTH,WE BUILD UP ON CAPITALIZING AND IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS,BRINGING OUT THE BEST IN THEM,AND ENSURING THAT THEIR SKILLS AND ABILITIES DON'T GO INTO WASTE.
    <br>
    <p>The core aim of this establishment was not only to make profit but to ensure that youths with special skills and abilities know how to maximize profit using what they have,the economy nowadays focuses more on you get what you want based on what you have so i believe my organization can empower youths and help them maximise their skills.
